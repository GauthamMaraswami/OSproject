# OSproject
This is one of my project done in summer 2016 under Summer Mentorship Programme it is an operating system running on bochs src it
has nearly the same functionality that CP/M did in the early 1980s, and is almost as powerful as MSÂ­DOS version 1. may be little less it
has the following command capabality like 
 command                    function
 type filename              to print contents of the file on the screen
 del filename               to delete the file of name filename
 create filename            to create file with filename and feed contents into it
 execute filename           to execute the file
 copy filename1 filename2   to copy contents of filename1 to filename2 without deleting the filename1
 kill                       to kill the process running
 cd directoryname           to change the current directory
 mkdir directoryname        to create new directory
 pwd                        to print the directory name
 
 all other commands are considered bad commands
